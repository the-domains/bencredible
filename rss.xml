            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Guide To Great Coffee In Kichijoji, Tokyo - Sprudge</h1><p>Spring in Japan is marked by the cherry blossom, when pink clouds of the blooming flower paint on a canvas of clear blue sky. It's a time to celebrate the beautiful transience of life, which the locals often do at picnics in the park-known as -under a gentle rain of falling petals.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5deb09d7253cefed9c88b1d256141d53382a8173.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Techies Project by Photographer Helena Price</h1><p>The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
